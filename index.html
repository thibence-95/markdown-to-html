<h4>If you ever spot me staring into the distance, this is probably what I'm thinking about:</h4>
<p>
	It was the end of July 2012, My dad and I went to visit friends in NYC for a week.
	Going there was an amazing experience.<br>I went out to local skateparks and shredded
	around the city streets on my trusty skateboard.<br>
	When I was at LES Skatepark underneath Manhattan Bridge. IT HAPPENED. After 2 years of trying oh so hard<br>
	I finally landed my first ever Kick-flip (a basic,yet cool, skateboard trick) I had people turning heads
	when I shouted "F* YES, I DID IT!".<br>For the rest of the trip I brought my skateboard everywhere I could,
	popping Kick-flips left, right and centre.
</p>
<p>
	When we got back to Belgium I met up with some of my friends A.S.A.P
	to show them I could finally pull it off but suddenly I no longer could so my friends didn't
	believe me.
</p>
<p>
	I haven't landed the bastard trick ever since.
	My friends and I have slowly stopped skating by now and they still think it's all horse shit to this day.
</p>

<p>
	<b>TL;DR</b><br>
	The gravity in New York is different than it is anywhere else, I swear!<br>
	Who needs friends anyway...
